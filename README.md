# User Story
As a administrator, I send a lot of emails to many individuals and groups. I want to be able to measure my email's tone; postive, negative, or nuetral. After receiving the overall tone of my email I want to be able to determine the specific section in which my email carries this tone or at least is most affected so I can modify it as needed.

## Set-up
1. First you create a google cloud account and install [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) and the necessary packages for [client libraries](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/cloud-client-libraries)
2. set up a project using either the Google Cloud Console on the web browser or the gcloud command for the Google Cloud SDK Shell
3. Create a service account and make the service account the account linked to the authorization keys (from this step you should recieve a json file)
4. clone this github and fill in the required fields (json file)
